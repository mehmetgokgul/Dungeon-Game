A large, empty space with cold stone floors. A heavy silence fills the air, broken only by the occasional gust of wind that seems to seep in from somewhere. An unmoving figure stands at the far end of the courtyard, its eyes following your every move. As you approach, you realize the figure is a stone-like statue, eerily lifelike, its gaze unblinking.  
Ebony Shield (+5 hp. A rare, dark shield made from ebony, known for its durability and ability to protect the wearer.)  
Creature: [3,1]

[3,2] - The Dungeon Lord's Lair  
The final room. The walls are lined with ominous, blood-stained stone and a cold, oppressive atmosphere fills the air. At the far end, seated upon a throne made of ancient bones, sits the Dungeon Lord, eyes burning with malevolent power. The room is filled with the echoes of countless battles fought and lost. The Dungeon Lord awaits and only the strongest will leave this chamber alive. Prepare for your greatest battle.
